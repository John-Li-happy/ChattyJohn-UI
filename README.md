# ChattyJohn-UI
A chatty robot designed for memorial days when I was young

## Discription
The core of the chatbot is following convolutional neural network(CNN) which applied on 9-layer deep learning. By compling with language packages(English, chatterbot-corpus) and emotion packages, the chatterbot owns its own logic of expressing, listening, and processing language information.

I built this to memerize the days when I was young

## Technique 
Model-View-ViewModel(MVVM)
Observation
Delegation
Machine Learning

## Todos
1. Emoji package is developed by "google", and it could be applied on image response (VGG-19 package)
2. Code utilization is avaliable for populating Ui elements
3. Chat pops could have a better UI
4. More devices could be adjusted(by applying NotificaitonCenter)

## IDE
Xcode 12.1

Anaconda Spyder 4.1.4

Swift 5.3

Python 3.7.9

Right now only fit for 6.5 inch devices (iPhone11 Pro Max, iPhone XS Max)

## Permission
The main purpose of this project is to bring enjoyment to those who have spare time to cut, also to offer a good chance for developers who is also interested in iOS developing to discuss. This is an open source project, but it is not allowed to use it as any commercial-purposes.
